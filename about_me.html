        <h3>A Quick Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            I am a 17-year old freshman at Carlow University, majoring in Chemistry. I'm working 
            towards a minor in Computer Science, which is why I'm currently taking a coding class.
            I work part-time at a horse barn, and also part-time at a political non-profit, doing 
            graphic design work.

        <h3>My Favorite Hobby</h3>
        <p>
            My favorite hobby is horse riding. I currently own a horse named Maggie, as well as a 
            mini-horse named Turnip. As I said above, I work at a horse barn, which has given me 
            much experience with handling horses, as well as administering medicine. I can ride both
            English and Western, but I prefer Western Gaming like pole-bending and barrell racing.
